Do what I told you ,do not modify any other file without my permisson.


I've finished the basic part of my website frontend: The ocean in mid-night and a profile component
all the components are like frosted glass texture.
-------------------------------------------
Now I'm going to make a music-player component with frosted glass  texture on the leftside ,help me with that
-------------------------------------------
I have made a music-player component with frosted glass texture on the left-mid side, and gave the title and the music-player a fade-in animation. The profile and music player will fade in after the title fades out.
-------------------------------------------
I have added a floating paper component that shows the word "BLOG" when hovered. It also has a fade-in animation.
-------------------------------------------
I have redesigned the music player to be a minimalist line-art Walkman with a frosted glass texture and spinning reel animations.
-------------------------------------------
I have moved the music player to the top-left and redesigned it as a minimalist line-art gramophone.
-------------------------------------------
I have simplified the music player to show only the song name and a play button, maintaining the frosted glass texture and fade-in animation.
